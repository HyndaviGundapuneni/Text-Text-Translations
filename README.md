This is a simple and interactive **Language Translation App** built using **Streamlit**, **Google Translate API**, and **gTTS** (Google Text-to-Speech). The app allows users to input text in any language, translate it into a target language, and listen to the translated text through generated speech.

## Features

- **Text Translation:** Input text can be translated into any target language.
- **Text-to-Speech:** Translated text is converted to speech, and users can listen to it.
- **Multiple Language Support:** Select from a variety of languages for translation and audio playback.
